# Plan: 02-02 - Controls & Interaction [PH2-CONTROLS]

**Goal:** Implement betting controls (Fold, Check, Call, Bet/Raise) and a betting slider.

## Context
The player needs to interact with the game state machine. Controls must be intuitive and follow the pixel-art aesthetic.

## Proposed Changes

### 1. Components
- **`ActionButtons`**: A group of buttons for Fold, Check, Call, and Bet.
- **`BetSlider`**: A custom-styled range input for selecting bet amounts, with increments based on the pot size.
- **`GameController`**: A container that bridges the UI controls to the `poker-state-machine`.

### 2. Interaction Logic
- Disable buttons when it's not the player's turn.
- Calculate valid bet ranges (Min Raise to All-in).
- Update the game state on action.

## Verification Plan

### Automated Tests
- Create `components/__tests__/ActionButtons.test.tsx`.
- Mock the game state and verify that clicking "Fold" triggers the correct state transition.

### Manual Verification
- Verify that buttons are disabled/enabled correctly during a game loop.
- Test the slider for boundary conditions (min bet, max bet).
