# Plan: 02-03 - Visuals & Feedback [PH2-VISUALS]

**Goal:** Add card visuals, animations, and immediate feedback UI.

## Context
Visual feedback is crucial for engagement. We need to see cards being dealt and chips moving, and get immediate feedback on our actions.

## Proposed Changes

### 1. Card Components
- **`CardView`**: A pixel-art representation of a poker card.
- **`CardBack`**: A stylized back design.
- **`SuitIcon`**: Small pixel icons for Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs, Spades.

### 2. Animations
- Use `framer-motion` for:
  - Dealing cards from a deck position to player seats.
  - Pushing chips to the center pot.
  - Hover effects on buttons.

### 3. Feedback UI
- **`FeedbackOverlay`**: A toast or overlay that pops up after an action to say "Great Move!" or "Inaccurate: GTO suggests folding here."

## Verification Plan

### Automated Tests
- Test that `CardView` renders the correct rank and suit.
- Ensure `FeedbackOverlay` shows the correct message based on action quality.

### Manual Verification
- Observe animations in the browser.
- Verify feedback triggers correctly after player actions.
