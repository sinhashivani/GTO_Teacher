# Plan: 04-02 - Hand History Viewer [PH4-HISTORY]

**Goal:** Implement a way for players to review past hands.

## Context
Reviewing past hands is key to learning. We need a list of hands from the current session.

## Proposed Changes

### 1. UI Components
- **`HandHistoryList`**: A scrollable list of past hands.
- **`HandSummaryCard`**: Displays the final board, player cards, and the result (Win/Loss).

### 2. Integration
- Add a "History" toggle or button to the main game view.

## Verification Plan

### Manual Verification
- Complete multiple hands and verify they appear in the history list with correct details.
