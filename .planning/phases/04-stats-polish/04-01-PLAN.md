# Plan: 04-01 - Session Stats Dashboard [PH4-STATS]

**Goal:** Create a dashboard to display session statistics (Win Rate, Decision Accuracy).

## Context
Players need to track their progress and identify leaks. We'll use Dexie.js to aggregate hand history data.

## Proposed Changes

### 1. Data Tracking
- Update `HandHistory` in `db.ts` to include `decisionAccuracy: number`.
- Update `GameController` to calculate and store accuracy for each hand.

### 2. Stats UI
- **`StatsDashboard`**: A component that summarizes:
  - Total Hands Played.
  - Overall Profit/Loss.
  - Win Rate (BB/100 or simply % hands won).
  - Decision Accuracy %.
- Display this in a new "Stats" modal or drawer.

## Verification Plan

### Manual Verification
- Play several hands and check the stats dashboard for accurate updates.
