# Plan: 03-01 - Bot AI Baselines [PH3-BOT]

**Goal:** Implement the bot AI logic for Easy, Medium, and Expert levels.

## Context
The bot needs to make decisions (Fold, Check, Call, Raise) based on its current hand and the game state. 

## Proposed Changes

### 1. Bot Logic
- **`BotAI`**: A class or set of functions to handle decision making.
- **Easy Mode**: High randomness, often calls or folds poorly.
- **Medium Mode**: Plays conservatively, uses basic hand strength.
- **Expert Mode**: Uses range-based heuristics and aggressive betting.

### 2. Integration
- Integrate the bot's decision into the `GameController`'s action loop.

## Verification Plan

### Automated Tests
- Create `lib/poker/__tests__/bot.test.ts` to verify bot decisions for specific hand strengths.

### Manual Verification
- Play against the bot in the browser and verify it takes actions.
