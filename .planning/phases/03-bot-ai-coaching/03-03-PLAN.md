# Plan: 03-03 - Opponent Insights & Helpers [PH3-INSIGHTS]

**Goal:** Implement hand strength display and opponent range estimations.

## Context
Helpful UI elements that guide the player's understanding of the current hand.

## Proposed Changes

### 1. Hand Strength Helper
- Display the player's current best hand name (e.g., "Three of a Kind, Jacks").
- Update in real-time as community cards are dealt.

### 2. Opponent Insight
- **`InsightPanel`**: A UI component showing the likely range categories for the opponent.

## Verification Plan

### Manual Verification
- Verify hand names are accurate during play.
- Check that the insight panel updates correctly.
