# Plan: 03-02 - Recommendation Engine [PH3-COACHING]

**Goal:** Implement the recommendation system that suggests the best action to the player.

## Context
Players need feedback to learn GTO. We need to compare the player's action with an "Expert" bot's recommendation.

## Proposed Changes

### 1. Recommendation Logic
- **`getRecommendation`**: A function that runs the "Expert" bot logic for the player's position.
- **Rationale Engine**: Simple text generation explaining *why* an action is recommended (e.g., "Top pair is usually a bet here").

### 2. UI Updates
- Trigger `FeedbackOverlay` based on the comparison of player action vs recommendation.

## Verification Plan

### Automated Tests
- Test `getRecommendation` with known strong/weak hands.

### Manual Verification
- Perform actions in-game and verify the coaching feedback appears.
